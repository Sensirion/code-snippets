# Bathroom Anti Fogging
This project demonstrates how to use a Sensirion SHT temperature and humidity
sensor to avoid bathroom mirrors from fogging up with maximal power efficiency.

The full project is documented on
[developer.sensirion.com/labs/anti-fogging-for-bathroom-mirrors](https://developer.sensirion.com/labs/anti-fogging-for-bathroom-mirrors/)


## Code Snippet
The arduino project code is provided as [MirrorHeater.ino](MirrorHeater.ino).

## Dependencies
Use Arduino's Library Manager to install Sensirion's `arduino-sht` library which
provides the driver for Sensirion SHT temperature and humidity sensors.
